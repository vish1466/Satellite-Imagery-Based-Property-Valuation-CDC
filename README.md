Multimodal House Price Prediction using Satellite Imagery & Tabular Data

Overview : 
This project predicts house prices by combining structured tabular features with satellite imagery using a multimodal deep learning approach. In addition to prediction, the model is made interpretable using Grad-CAM, which highlights regions of satellite images that influence pricing decisions.

The project explores:
- Traditional tabular-only modeling (XGBoost)
- A CNN + MLP multimodal architecture
- Visual explainability via Grad-CAM
